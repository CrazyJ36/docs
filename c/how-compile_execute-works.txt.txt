At least for desktop apps,
cl compiler generates .obj,
linker combines .obj with included .lib,
exe is created.

Normally the libs: kernel32.lib, user32.lib, gdi.lib(graphical desktop)
are included. Those contain dll names and reference code that is bound to exe.
Then windows can resolve the calls to those internal library names
and handle execution.
