GCC can be optimized for the best runtime program speed.
Tested with, and this doc-file is for Toshiba-Ubuntu Laptop.

Use these commands:
export DEBIAN_BUILDARCH=pentium
export DEBIAN_GCCVER=7
builder-cc -mtune=pentium -march=native -O3 file.c -o prog-name

-march and -mtune are similar.

-O3 (letter O), enables optimization options(level 3) during compile time for the best run-time speed.

The pentium-builder package enables gcc to build for the pentium architecture (Toshiba)
with the above commands. See man builder-cc.
