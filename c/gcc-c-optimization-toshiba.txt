gcc can use optimization as 

Use these commands:
export DEBIAN_BUILDARCH=pentium
export DEBIAN_GCCVER=7
gcc -mtune=pentium -O3 file.c

The 3 Flags are for optimization.
-march=native could do for unknown(by me) platfroms.
-O3 (letter O), enables optimization options(level 3) during compile time.
The pentium-builder package enabled good speed with the above command. See man builder-cc.
