I made this usable with vs build tools basic cl compiler.

This is for compiling basic console and desktop applications with no IDE.

- Download/install Visual Studio Build Tools, to get Developer Command
  Prompt for VS.

- Simple C desktop program code:
________ 
#include <windows.h>
//#pragma comment(lib,"user32.lib")

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
    MessageBox(NULL, "Hello, World", "Note", MB_OK);
    return 0;
}
________
The commented #pragma line is optional, it calls "desktop program" linker
in place. If this wasn't in the code, you could link "user32.lib" when compiling with:
# Code and Compile
> cl program.c /link User32.LIB

- Simple console program code (no different than linux at basic level):
________
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World");
	return 0;
}
________
Compile with:
> cl program.c
run this from cmd in the programs' compiled directory:
> program.exe

cl generates .exe and .obj(machine code) files with the original
.c program name. The .obj file is not necessary to run the new single-file 
program .exe, but may be needed to import code later.

# Compiler options
- cl compiler options are listed here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options-listed-by-category?view=vs-2017
- some important options are:
  >cl prog.c /O2 /GALw    max windows optimization
  /GALw is a combination(/GA, /GL) of windows whole program global optimization.
