gcc can use optimization as 

gcc -march=pentium -mtune=pentium -O3 file.c

The 3 Flags are for optimization.
I'm not sure if -march or -mtune are correctly set.
-march=native will do.
-O3 (letter O), enables optimization options during compile time.
The pentium-builder package auto does this when you configure A few items. See man builder-cc.
