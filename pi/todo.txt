# Gathering info first, organize later into instructions.

### startup
work on .profile script and make sure no graphics(xserver, vnc)
run at startup.

#### VNC
I think Vnc server runs at boot verify(and disable)

in ~/.profile, I have 'export DISPLAY=":1"' as that was normally used while 
not being used to it. try on next boot with display0.

Vnc server seems to run be always running 'virtual' mode,
# Stopped with:
$ vncserver-virtual -kill :1

### AUDIO
here:

audio worked. A package was bluealsa. try other methods, no package first.
