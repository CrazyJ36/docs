- in pi: change /etc/ssh_config(and sshd_config) 'Port' to
unique port like 23456 to not cross other system configs.
- in router config(browse to 192.168.0.1): add port forward entry
using above port numbers. With pi's private ip as host.
- while not connected to home wifi: '$ ssh -p 23456 pi@public-ip'
