- in pi: change /etc/sshd_config 'Port' to unique port like 23456
to not cross other system configs. don't change 'ssh_config', ssh_config
port must stay 22 for outside services, like bitbucket to get in.
- in router config(browse to 192.168.0.1): add port forward entry
using above port numbers. With pi's private ip as host.
- while not connected to home wifi: '$ ssh -p 23456 pi@public-ip'
