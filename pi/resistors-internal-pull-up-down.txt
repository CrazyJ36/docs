# What are internal pull-up and down Resistors?
These internal resistors serve the only needed resistor
in A circuit that uses inputs such as buttons.
They will keep GPIOs' from reading incorrect input
state, as in wether A circut is open or closed.
The resistors 'force' the gpio pin into A open or
closed state as needed for it's desired function.
Whether they should be set as pull-up or pull-down
in code depends on whether your code should be
on or off by default.


# Default behaviour.
By default, the first eight GPIOs have pull-ups enabled,
and the rest have pull-downs enabled.

# Pull-down.
When you have a circuit that connects 3.3v to a GPIO pin as
closed when HIGH, it could read anything.
You need a "pull down" resistor connecting your circuit
to ground, so that it reads LOW when the circuit is open.

# Pull-up.
if you have a circuit connecting your GPIO pin to ground when
it's closed, it'll read LOW. You need a "pull up" resistor so that,
when it's open, it defaults to the HIGH state.
