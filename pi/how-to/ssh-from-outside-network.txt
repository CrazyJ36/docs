- in pi: change /etc/sshd_config 'Port' to unique port like 23456
DO NOT 'ssh_config', this files port must stay 22 for outside services, 
like bitbucket/github to get in.

- in router config(browse to 192.168.1.1): add port forward entry
using above port numbers. With pi's private ip as host.
Example:
Name: PI2 SSH Public
Protocol: TCP-UPD
External Host: * (meaning all, this specifies which machine ip can get in)
Internal Host: 192.168.1.166 (Pi2s' Local Wifi IP, use '$ ip address'(under wlan)
External Port: 1024 (Custom port, don't use 22, it interfears.)
Internal Port: 1024 (Must be the same as external port)

- while not connected to home wifi:
$ ssh -p [custom-port] pi@[your-wifis-public-ip]
