try to stick to cmdline. no need for all the 'ui-mods' packages,
though i should first:
fix audio (to toshiba) over bluetooth in pandora
try playing to bluetooth audio with mp3 file
there's a video in my development playlist on youtube on
how to use bluetooth from commandline.

finish raspberrypi-ui-mods install list file.
