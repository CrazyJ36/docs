# Multiple attachable hardware setups
Get several perma-proto boards for pi zero, and setup them up with
different hardware to make each board start as A different game, music
player, or other hardware systems. Could probably detect which board is
pluggin-in using some memory chip to start the hardware-specific program
when the different boards are plugged-in/powered on.

# constantly running 'main loop' app(started in /etc/rc.local)
- start at boot
- each button can start various functions in the system anytime(like start flashing led)
- should be used as A 'master control center' program for pi hardware functions.

# BLUETOOTH AUDIO
here:
https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/73706/how-can-i-select-the-audio-output-to-be-a-known-bluetooth-device-headless

when raspbian-desktop(raspberrypi-ui-mods) was running, bluetooth
audio worked. A package was bluealsa. try other methods, no package first.
video on youtube explaining pairing. the site above selects audio out to bluetooth


# POWER-IN DIRECTLY AT BOARD
The 5v pins can be used to power the pi. This would 
make A system even smaller.

# Battery
Self-explainatory, could purchase adafruit battery kit.

# USB DIRECT CONNECT FOR PERMANENT USB GADGET
Cut male usb cable to use it's wires.
Mount the usb port somehow on the pi

red- 5v
black - ground
green - center set of inward micro-usb bottom pins, closest to power
white - other inward pin of micro-usb pin
