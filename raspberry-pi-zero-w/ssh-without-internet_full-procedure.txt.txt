# Windows
-in windows after flash os image with etcher usb
- in boot partition append to config.txt:
 dtoverlay=dwc2
- in boot partition cmdline.txt append after 'rootwait':
 modules-load=dwc2,g_ether
- (may or may not need to blank 'ssh' file in boot partition in windows)
- insert sd into pi
- connect usb from pi OTG(not power) to usb in pc
- if windows doesn't see pi as usb ethernet/rndis gadget network controller type,
 instead a com-port serial device, update com-port driver with files located at:
 'Google Drive'\Programs\Windows\Programs\Development\RaspberryPI\RPI Driver OTG.zip,
 then unplug/replug pi from pc.
- ssh pi@raspberrypi.local (default password: raspberry).
- bonjour required for internet adapter sharing(extract bonjour setup from package)

# Linux
- in pi(through ssh or by mounting PIs' sd) edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf and add:
_____
interface usb0
static ip_address=192.168.7.2
static routers=192.168.7.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.7.1
_____
the last two numbers in the IPs' can be any numbers that are free around local networks,
though the last 1 must be 1 at the last two entries.
- on linux pc: 
- find interface name(probably enp0s29f..):
  $ ip link
- add the PIs' ip to PCs' interface card
  $ ip a add 192.168.7.1/24 dev <interface-name>
- $ ssh pi@192.168.7.2
- if no internet in pi, you could connect PIs' usb to power and it should
  auto-connect with the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf network entry.
