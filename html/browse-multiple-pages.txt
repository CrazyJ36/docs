# To make 1 website domain root for multiple directories in apache2 server:

I used the default site, then added directories to that named website,
that enabled me to use only one website name, saving money if purchasing
A domain name.

Directories:
- main served site, served at a no-ip url:
/var/www/html/

- other directries
/var/www/html/other-site1
/var/www/html/other-site2

Then just append /other-site.. to the main /html url you normally would go to.
