Install/setup
Install Ubuntu Mini, don’t install any extra packages offered during the installation.
keep packages small size, build from source,
watch performance/ processes

no terminal at boot, blinking cursor:
When booted, press ctrl+alt+F1 for first to start A tty in the virtual tty desktops that Ubuntu mini comes with.

Wifi setup
After installing Ubuntu Mini on an old toshiba laptop, (even though during install it could connect to the internet to download required packages) when booted I had no internet,though adapters were shown to the system fine. Follow exactly this website for that situation: https://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/09/18/connect-to-wifi-network-from-command-line-in-linux/ no extra apps/packages needed.

In linux:
-<apt-get install x11vnc>

Using bVNC App, I get custom resolution:

TERMUX
For additional functionality/packages:

packages install python nodejs

This allows for pip and npm package managers, Greatly improving what can be done with just Termux. 

pip install mps rainbowstream
npm install how2
etc..
