To build android apps simply by using aapt on linux command line,
you need some files from google.
One is 'platform' or 'android.jar'. This makes android work.
To download it you should download directly from google with:
http://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-29_r03.zip
You can then put new 'android.jar' files (after unzip) in your local
sdk directory to build from command line. Refer to:
http://github.com/CrazyJ36/linux-scripts/build-android.sh
to see what is need to be done to build android apps using only A
few local files.

To download the reference documentation for android, use:
http://dl.google.com/android/repository/docs-24_r01.zip
This allows the same reference from developer.android.com to 
be used offline.

All android api class sources as java files:
