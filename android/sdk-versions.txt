It's easiest to only have and use the latest platfrom sdk installed.
At least for lg connect(2.3.6) and zte blade z max(nougat) support use:
in AndroidManifest.xml:
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="9" android:targetSdkVersion="28" />
before application tag.

The devices will pull there specific api levels at runtime to use themes, etc.
