Instructions:

2. on PC, enter command to restart adb sever for network use:
$ adb tcpip 5555

3. on PC, connect over network:
$ adb connect [PHONE_WIFI_IP]

4. disconnect from usb, adb over network will still be connected.

TODO:
find other ways/workarounds, like:
do you need to connect over usb at all? Maybe 'adb tcpip' will activate the functionality without usb at first
