# If the previous command had two arguments, like this:
$ ls a.txt b.txt
# and you wanted to re-use the first one
# in A new command, you could type:
$ program !:1
# giving:
a.txt
# Or if you wanted both, you could type
$ program !:1-2
# this inserting the arguments:
a.txt b.txt
# You can extend this to any number of arguments, eg:
$ program !:10-12
