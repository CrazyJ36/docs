# this will make your ubuntu installation the absolute minimum console pc system, .

# aptitude does the trick here.
$ sudo apt-get install aptitude ubuntu-minimal

# this command tells the system that every package besides 'ubuntu-minimal' is not required.
$ sudo aptitude markauto `~i!~nubuntu-minimal`

# remove all the uneeded packages(there will be a lot).
$ sudo apt-get autoremove --purge

# done.
# you can remove aptitude is you don't need it now.
# also if your kernel package 'linux-image-generic' is not installed or removed,
# install it before reboot.
