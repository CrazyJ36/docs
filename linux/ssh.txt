# fix for: ssh commmand or appears successful then goes right back to bash prompt
- cause: target system or ip address has probably changed.
-fix: edit ~/.ssh/known_hosts
delete the line that contains info for the desired(to-be-connected-to) ip address.
connect again: ssh user@host. without using sshpass.

# connect to an ssh server using private/public keys
# instead of using 'sshpass'. You should copy keys
# to/from server/client device on per-device basis
# like 'directories named after desired pc.' 
ssh -i path/to/id_rsa user@host

# Termux
-for ftp, use sftp, ftp implementation 
 support no authentication
- ssh server avilable with:
$ sshd
 stop the server with:
$ pkill sshd
See https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access for

# SSH Ports
To avoid conflicts, you should make different ports for ssh-in connections
and ssh-out connections. ssh-in meaning ssh to this server from anywhere.
ssh out meaning to connect to other computers, or git.
- /etc/ssh/ssh_config should stay port 22, this allows any 'normal'
server(like bitbucket, github) to be reached for git push/pull.
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config shoud be changed to an unused port(like 23456)
so that any device can connect to your server from anywhere while 
avoiding conflicts.
