# fix for: ssh commmand or appears successful then goes right back to bash prompt
- cause: target system or ip address has probably changed.
-fix: edit ~/.ssh/known_hosts
delete the line that contains info for the desired(to-be-connected-to) ip address.
connect again: ssh user@host. without using sshpass.

# connect to an ssh server using private/public keys
# instead of using 'sshpass'. You should copy keys
# to/from server/client device on per-device basis
# like 'directories named after desired pc.' 
ssh -i path/to/id_rsa user@host
