# fix for: ssh commmand or appears successful then goes right back to bash prompt
- cause: target system or ip address has probably changed.
-fix: edit ~/.ssh/known_hosts
delete the line that contains info for the desired(to-be-connected-to) ip address.
connect again: ssh user@host. without using sshpass.
