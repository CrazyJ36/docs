There are two files in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-[on,off]

wifi.powersave = [0,1,2,3] options mean:

- 0 = NM_SETTING_WORELESS_POWERSAVE_DEFAULT: default setting. I don't know what
default is(normal, when needed?)

- 1 = NM_SETTING_WIRELESS_POWERSAVE_IGNORE: don't touch setting

- 2 = NM_SETTING_WIRELESS_POWERSAVE_DISABLE: disable powersaving

- 3 = NM_SETTING_WIRELESS_POWERSAVE_ENABLE: enable powersaving
