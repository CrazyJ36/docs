- Remove any config existent config files.
$ sudo rm /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf 
$ sudo rm /var/lib/dhcp/dhcp.leases

- reboot to clear wpa_supplicants config after this

- start wpa_cli. run the whole setup in sudo
$ sudo wpa_cli

- scan for wireless networks if wpa_cli hasn't done so already
> scan

- view the scan results to get the ssid name
> scan_results

- add A new network id to wpa as configuration in linux
> add_network 0

- set the new network 0's ssid name (type with the quotes in ssid)
> set_network 0 ssid "SSID Name"

- set the new network 0's network password (type with the quotes in psk password)
> set_networt 0 psk "secretpassword"

- enable this new virtual network id
> enable_network 0

- save this config to pc. likely at /etc/wpa_suppicant/myconfig.conf
> save config

- internet should work after this. open new terminal(alt-2 for no graphical pc setup) to test:
$ ip a

- now if the machine is rebooted, wpa_supplicant can be started as before
and it will connect to the "SSID Name" network with this command:
$ wpa_supplicant -B -i {your-adapter-interface(wlp4s0)} -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/myconfig.conf
