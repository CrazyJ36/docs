# archive files
This simply stores multiple file into one files.tar

archive files: file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

explaination in argument order:

tar - linux utility to store multiple file in one file (archive)
c - tar option to create archive
f - tar option to use add files
files.tar - output archive name
file1.txt, file2.txt... - file to include in archive

$ tar cf files.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

# compress archive to reduce space
This compresses the output files.tar from above to save some space

compress files

$ gzip file.tar

# show compresses file contents from archive
This shows file contents that are in a tar.gz
zcat file.tar.gz 

# decompress files
This decompresses all files from tar.gz to make them regular files again.
This works if files were first tar'd, then gzipped.

$ tar xf file.tar.gz
