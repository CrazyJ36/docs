As an alternative to installing the package 'file',
the 'od' program dumps file information.

$ od -An -t x1 -j 4 -N 1 program

It outputs octal format code, which can be 
translated by the abovd options.

Outputing '01' show the 5th bit of elf binary,
meaning it is 32 bit. An '02' means 64 bit.

Other uses of od:
# Display file.txt contents in octal format. One byte per int.
$ od -b file.txt

# Display file.txt content in ASCII character format, with byte offsets displayed as hexadecimal.
$ od -Ax -c file.txt
