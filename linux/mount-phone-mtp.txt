TODO: find out how to mount android fs with default packages,
so nothing has to be installed. otherwise, this method works great 
with little storage occupied.

fusermount should already be installed with ubuntu mini.

Install these:
$ sudo apt-get install libmtp-common libmtp9 jmtpfs

Android should be in mtp usb mode, (developer options off?).

$ mkdir ~/phone

or any other directory, though this doesn't work with root file points (eg. /mnt).

$ fmtpfs ~/phone

you can now manipulate, list, copy, etc.. internal storage.

to unmount:
$ fusermount -u ~/phone
