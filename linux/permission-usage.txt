# View file/folder permissions
ls -l
# Permissions look like this:
-r--r--r-- thomas
- permissions are broken into 4 sections.
- the first dash indicates: -(is file),d(is directory),i(is link).
- the next set of 3 dashes of characters signify permissions for 
  the owner of the file.
- the next set of 3 dashes are for members of the group
  owning the file.
- the next set of 3 dashes are for other users(os users).
- the ticks can show: r(read),w(write),x(execute).
- the word at the end is the groups who owns it.
# chmod adds/removes permissions for owner(creator)
Syntax: 
chmod (+-rwx) 'name of file of directory.
- this only changes permissions for the owner(creator) of the file.

# Changing permissions for others
Syntax: 
chmod (goua+-rwx)
- g(group),u(users),o(others),a(all)
- a=r will give everyone read permission

# Changing ownership of files/folders to groups
Syntax:
chgrp (name of group) 'name of file'

# Changing ownership
Syntax:
chown (new owner name) 'name of file'

# other
- change user and group permission in one command:
chown -R user:group /dir/path

# numeric mode
you add these numbers to develop A set of permission.
repeat for who needs permission.
0 = no permission
1 = execute
2 = write
4 = read
- all added would be 7, for rwx to user, group, and others,
  you'd write 777.

numbers reference:
0 = ---
1 = --1
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r-
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx
