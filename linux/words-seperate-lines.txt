# The following command turns this::
this is a line
# into this:
this 
is 
a 
line

$ echo `cat file.txt` | tr ' ' '\n' > file-lined.txt

# meaning:
# echo file.txt, if there is a space(''), insert 
# newline instead, and output this format to
# file-lined.txt

# the 'tr' command can replace text in this way.
